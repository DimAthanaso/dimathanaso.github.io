ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm **Dimitrios Athanasopoulos**, Ph.D., a researcher in asteroid science and planetary astronomy.  
I specialise in the **spin state evolution and physical characterisation of ancient asteroid families**, aiming to uncover the origin and history of our Solar System.

I'm a support astronomer at the **National Observatory of Athens**, contributing to near-Earth object monitoring, and lead author of several peer-reviewed studies on asteroid dynamics and photometry.
